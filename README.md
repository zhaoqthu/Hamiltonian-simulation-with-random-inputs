files:

Julia code:
main         : main file to generate empirical bounds, triangle bounds, interference bounds, and counting bounds.
rand_input   : all the functions we used

Matlab code:
matlabtrotternumber: worst-case empirical results

Mathematica code
   : comparing bounds with and without the Cauchy inequality. See Sec V in the Supplemental MaterialCancel changes
